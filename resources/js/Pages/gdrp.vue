                <p class="text--light editor-ouput"></p>
                <p>After the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (EU) 2016/679
                    ("<strong>GDPR</strong>"), as an obligation based on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between
                    EU
                    and North Macedonia, a new data protection regime was adopted. Since 2020, the matter of personal data
                    protection in the Republic of North Macedonia is regulated by the new Act on Personal Data Protection
                    (Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia, nos. 42/20, 294/21) ("<strong>LPDP</strong>"),
                    effective as of 24&nbsp;February&nbsp;2020.</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
            <div class="editor-output margin--bottom-lg">
                <p>The LPDP follows, almost in its entirety, the content of the GDPR. Like the GDPR, the LPDP set a
                    transitional
                    period of 18 months, later prolonged by six months, for data controllers and processors to adapt and
                    harmonise their operations.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the same transitional period was foreseen for the adoption of the bylaws based on the LPDP.
                    That
                    said, most of the bylaws were adopted by the Personal Data Protection Agency of North Macedonia
                    ("<strong>DPA</strong>") in May&nbsp;2020, which marked the completion of the legislative process,
                    leaving
                    only the implementation process ahead.</p>
                <p>In addition to the adoption of the legal framework, the DPA has published a series of guidelines that
                    rely to
                    a great extent on the Guidelines of the European Data Protection Board. Until now, the DPA has issued
                    the
                    guidelines dealing with the protection of personal data in the finance sector, the
                    transfer of personal data to third countries and international organisations

                    data protection officers in the public and private sector, the use
                    of cookies and lawful
                    data processing.</p>
                <p>Concerning enforcement of the LPDP and the harmonisation of the remaining legal framework with the LPDP,
                    the
                    DPA is still not sufficiently proactive. First, the DPA still does not impose any sanctions, but only
                    warns
                    data controllers and processors. Also, the DPA is not systematically consulted on sectoral laws or
                    implementing legislation and its advice is not always taken on board.</p>
                <h2>Challenges of public institutions to maintain data privacy</h2>
                <p>While the DPA does focus on raising awareness and education at institutions in relation to data
                    protection,
                    most of its activities are directed at the public sector. Furthermore, the DPA's reluctance to sanction
                    has
                    affected overall data protection awareness in North Macedonia. While some positive steps have recently
                    been
                    taken in this direction, they have mainly been driven by a series of ransomware cyberattacks on
                    Macedonian
                    public institutions that affected a large amount of personal data of Macedonian citizens. Between 2021
                    and
                    2022, seven public institutions were targeted, including the Health Fund of North Macedonia, especially
                    websites with the official governmental domain (gov.mk).</p>
                <p>The cyberattack on the Health Fund was one of the most controversial cases, since the personal data of
                    almost
                    two million citizens were affected. After the attack there were a series of reactions about the level of
                    personal data protection, the most relevant of which were from the Macedonian State Audit Office. In
                    particular, the State Audit Office had warned about the insufficient level of data protection and IT
                    security of the Health Fund several years back in its reports to both the National Assembly and
                    Government.
                    Although these incidents did raise public awareness about data privacy and protection, the DPA still did
                    not
                    respond properly to the incidents. The DPA neither sanctioned any of the institutions for the lack of
                    cybersecurity measures nor issued a public statement in relation to them.</p>
                <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>
                <p>Despite the adoption of a modernised legal framework for data protection in North Macedonia, largely
                    based on
                    EU practices, recent findings imply that the DPA is not sufficiently educated and agile in its role of
                    supervisory authority. Enforcement of the LPDP with a proactive DPA at the helm should be a priority
                    throughout the following period. Therefore, effective implementation of the LPDP should target all the
                    incompliant market players while the DPA is expected to take a more proactive role.</p>
